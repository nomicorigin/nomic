<h2 id="initial-set-of-rules">Initial Set of Rules</h2>
<h3 id="immutable-rules"><em>Immutable Rules</em></h3>
<p><strong>101.</strong> All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).</p>
<p><strong>102.</strong> Initially rules in the 100&#39;s are immutable and rules in the 200&#39;s are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>
<p><strong>103.</strong> A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.</p>
<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)</p>
<p><strong>104.</strong> All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>116.</strong> Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-rules"><em>Mutable Rules</em></h3>
<p><strong>201.</strong> Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.</p>
<p>In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname.</p>
<p><strong>202.</strong> One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one&#39;s score.</p>
<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>213.</strong> If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge&#39;s best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.</p>
<p>This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.</p>
